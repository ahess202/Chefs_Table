#Capstone Project Overview
#Dish Search
##Elevator Pitch
**********************************************
The app will be designed for those that want to access a quick and easy database of recipes, sorted by cuisine nation-of-origin, ingredient, difficulty level, total time etc. Users will be able to register an account on the website, and have the ability to save their favorite recipes as well as create their own and post it to the site.
Ideally, they will be able to receive feedback on their recipes through a comment section at the bottom of the recipe.

##Key Features
**********************************************
- View a database(possibly an external API) of recipes for various dishes
- View lists of dishes, ingredients, cuisine-types, users and dish images
- Sort lists by different elements of a dish, such as total time, number of ingredients, alphabetical-order or
 difficulty
- View related lists by clicking links, such as "View all dishes using this ingredient" or "View all dishes of this cuisine-type"
- 2 user types, home-cook and verified-chef. Verified chefs would have their recipes promoted on the home page.

##Future Features:
**********************************************
- View more detailed information of an ingredient such as a link to possible allergies it may be included in and other nutritional or dietary information
- View more detailed information of a dish such as the recipe, which may be a typed out recipe in the database or a link to an external recipe on another site(user-preference, external links will require sources)
- Create an administrator account-type that can create, edit or delete any dish, as well as delete users 
- Create user profiles that can store a list of favorite dishes from the site, as well as create their own
- Display NYT Food Section top stories somewhere on the page
- View a list of the top certified chefs on the site to view their profiles and top recipes.
- Restaurant copycat recipes, and a list by restaurant feature
##Technologies List
